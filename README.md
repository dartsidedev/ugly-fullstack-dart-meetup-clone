A Meetup clone using nothing but Dart.

## Background

> UG.ly! Yeah, easiest thing ever is naming things. Hmmm. I'm developing an app that's similar to Meetup.com and focuses on user groups... UG... Now, I need one of the fancy top-level domains that the cool kids use. `.dev`, `.io`, `.ly`, `.app`. Oh! `UG.ly`, terrific. Let's buy that domain, I'm sure it's still free and I'm the first person on the planet who thought of this.

Well, well, well, all jokes aside. This project should be ready this weekend, so better get started.

This repository contains a simplified [Meetup](https://meetup.com) clone written in Dart. The web app, the mobile app, and the backend are all written in Dart. This project serves as an experiment for my talk about Full-stack development in Dart.

> Meetup is a service used to organize online groups that host in-person events for people with similar interests. - [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup)
