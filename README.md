> Implement a Meetup clone using nothing but Dart. Limited functionality.

This repository contains a simplified [Meetup](https://meetup.com) clone written in Dart. The web app, the mobile app, and the backend are all written in Dart. This project serves as an experiment for my talk about Full-stack development in Dart.

> Meetup is a service used to organize online groups that host in-person events for people with similar interests. - [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup)
